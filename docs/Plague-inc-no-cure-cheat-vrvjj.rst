Oh, maybe the table or the scripts/pointers needs to be activated in a specific moment? I tried to load it once in a game and it didn't work. As the title says, the cheat plague that is claimed to be incurable is being cured by those annoying humans. Anyone else have this problem? You will have to wait at this point, devolving all mutated symptoms. Even if the symptom is non-lethal it must still be devolved. Immediately pop the cure.

Cheat Modes: No Cure, No Action and Infinite DNA; Beat all the gamemodes, Bacteria to Bioweapon all on Brutal. Neurax Worm; Beat all 6 plague types on Brutal. New game types such as Virus, Fungus, up to Bioweapon; You can unlock the next type by clearing the stage before it on Normal or Brutal difficulty. Plague inc. CHEATS!! | NO CURE AND UNLIMITED DNA CHEATS!Twitter -  -  f. no rules were presented so used the customise virus option.
