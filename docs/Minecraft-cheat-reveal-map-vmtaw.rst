/update map will update the map chunk thats in your hand with the chunk your in. Yes, but it would require you to have the map already. here is the basic command: /give [playername] minecraft:filled_map [amount of maps] [number of map]. Yeah there is one. It's "UP UP DOWN DOWN LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT B A". Upvote.

My S. Mode Map is about played out, and before I start a new one, I thought I would pimp it out with all the things I wanted, but didn't want to take the time to do, legit like. One of those things is a map room. (Idea stolen from here. Forgot who; Sorry) flying around, filling a map take forever. Is there a cheat code in creative to do this? In Minecraft, there are cheats and game commands that you can use to change game modes, time, weather, summon mobs or objects, or find the seed used by the World Generator. Here is the list of the different game commands available in Minecraft Java Edition (PC/Mac), Pocket Edition (PE), Windows 10 Edition and Education Edition. /reveal map will reveal the whole map chunk /update map will update the map chunk thats in your hand with the chunk your in or if part of that map was in area A and you where in B reveal map could also be set to what the map area in A was as well changing few things /map fill (fills a map that your holding).
